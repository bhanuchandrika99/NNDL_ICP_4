1. Data manipulation 
  - Read data from CSV file , Checked for null values and replaced with mean
  - Aggregated columns to find max, min,count, mean and filtered data based on given conditions
  - Dataframe modification, Dropping columns and creation of scatter plot 
  
2. Linear regression
  - Implmented test_train_split, Linear regression, mean_squared_error from scikit learn
  - Visualization of train and test data using scatter plot
